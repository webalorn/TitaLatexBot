# TitaLatexBot
Telegram Bot that receive an LaTeX equation and send it back as an image. You can make your own instance of the bot, and add your owns changes, or use the version I host myself : [TitaLatexBot](https://t.me/titalatexbot).

This is developed with [pyTelegramBotAPI](https://github.com/eternnoir/pyTelegramBotAPI) using the listener mechanism. This fork has been modified for my own usage, because I could not find a latex bot still working.

## Required packages

You need to install previously **Pillow**, **unidecode** and **pyTelegramBotAPI**. You can install them with pip.

```
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pyTelegramBotAPI pillow unidecode
```

## Usage

1. Create a bot with the [BotFather](https://t.me/botfather) Telegram Bot
	- To enable inline mode, use ```/setinline ```
2. Write configuration in ```conf.json``` (see below)
3. Execute the bot in your server with ```./bot.py```
4. In the Telegram client you can talk with your bot or add them to groups. All messages beggining with **/latex** will be catched by the bot. You can also use the inline mode with @nameofthebot.

For some functionalities to work, you need an http access to the downloaded images (the "results" folder). Write the url of the server in expose_url.txt. The images must be accessible at your_exposed_url/results/image_filename.

### Configuration

You must write your configuration in ```conf.json``` in the following format. ```expose_url``` is optional and can be leaved empty, or removed.

```json
{
	"token" : "your_bot_access_token",
	"expose_url" : "http://you_domain/subdirs/",
	"nb_recent_items" : 5
}
```

### Usage of the bot

- Send latex code or use the ```/latex``` command to generate images when talking to the bot
	- You can then send the image to other users
- Use ```/latex``` in group chats
- Type ```@nameofthebot``` in any chat, and then :
	- Leave empty and click on an image to send a latex code recently sent to the bot
	- Or type a latex expression

## About

Current developer : Th√©ophane Vallaeys ([webalorn](https://github.com/webalorn))

I made this bot from [LaTeX2IMGbot](https://github.com/analca3/LaTeX2IMGbot) by [analca3](https://github.com/analca3). Since there were bugs and many limitations, I created TitaLatex. Most of the code has been rewriten. Most of the code is new.

(And Tita is just the name I give to all my bots)
